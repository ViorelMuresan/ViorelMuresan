### Hi there 👋

<code>Digital Craftsman ( Enginner / Bussiness IT Arhitect  / Enthusiast Gamer & Husband)</code>

I'm an indie full-stack developer and content creator building my version of the digital world one step at a time. All coding projects are built from the ground up, from planning and designing all the way to solving real-life problems with code. All video content is built the same way, from ideation and planning, all the way to finalizing the content with artistic touches. I publish that content on my YouTube channel "<a href="https://youtube.com/fknight" rel="nofollow">ForrestKnight</a>" to more than 400k subscribers.
